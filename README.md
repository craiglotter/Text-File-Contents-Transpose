Text-File-Contents-Transpose
============================

 Text File Contents Transpose is a simple application that is able to take either a single or multi-line text file and transpose its contents. So a multi-line file will be forced into a single line file, using the specified delimiter character to separate the entries while a single line file will be split into multiple lines, using the specified delimiter character to split the line on.
